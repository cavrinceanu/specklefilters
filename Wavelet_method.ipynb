The selected method ('HAAR') has been chosen as representative for the author's application. To be replaced as necessary. Moreover, the selected method does not provide filtering parameters, which are strongly dependent on the data, hence parameters might vary and are not represented as default. Please try your own parameters beforhand. Furthermore, this implementation uses the guided filter and not the improved guided filter method proposed by Choi and Jeong.\n",
