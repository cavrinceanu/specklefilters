# Speckle filters

This repository archives the a collection of Jupyter notebooks used in the Python implementation of speckle filters used in the paper:

_Vrinceanu C., Grebby S., Marsh. S., (2023),  The performance of speckle Ô¨Ålters on Copernicus Sentinel-1 SAR images containing natural oil slicks, Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology, Geological Society of London (accepted for publishing)_

These Jupyter Notebooks are published in their 2019 version and have not been updated/maintained ever since.
We urge anyone re-using these to carefully consider and revise the code beforehand.

This repository will be updated at a later date.
