# Speckle filters

This repository archives the a collection of Jupyter notebooks used in the Python implementation of speckle filters used in the paper:
Vrinceanu C., Grebby S., Marsh. S., (2023),  The performance of speckle Ô¨Ålters on Copernicus Sentinel-1 SAR images containing natural oil slicks, Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology, Geological Society of London (accepted for publishing)

These Jupyter Notebooks are published in their 2019 version and have not been updated/maintained ever since. 
We urge anyone re-using these to carefully consider and revise the code beforehand.
